readme

This file is an attempt to create a short/simple tutorial on how to setup R
and RStudio with renv and git. It tries to start from the perspective of 
someone who has never used R or R Studio before.

The main function/purpose is to send it to new lab folks, so they can get
started with minimal fuss and hand holding.
